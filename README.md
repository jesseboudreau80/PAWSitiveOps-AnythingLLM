🐾 PAWSitiveOps – AnythingLLM
PAWSitiveOps-AnythingLLM is the AI backbone for the PAWSitiveOps platform.
It packages an AnythingLLM deployment and integration glue so we can run specialized compliance & operations chatbots for pet/vet centers, then expose them to React/FastAPI apps and n8n automations.

This repo focuses on infrastructure + integration (not the upstream AnythingLLM code).
Think: env setup, deploy configs, routing, and recipes to wire agents into real workflows.

🎯 Purpose
Provide a repeatable deployment of AnythingLLM (cloud or Docker)

Standardize workspace/agent setup for PAWSitiveOps personas (Compliance Hound, Sam the Safety Dog, etc.)

Offer clean endpoints so frontends (React) and services (FastAPI, n8n) can talk to our agents

Keep credentials and provider keys cleanly managed with environment variables

👨‍💻 My Role
Designed the deployment approach (Render/Docker) and env layout

Built integration patterns for webhooks, document ingestion, and chat completions

Planned the multi-agent routing so different PAWSitiveOps bots can serve multiple apps

Documented usage for teammates and future contributors

🛠️ Technologies Used
AnythingLLM – LLM router, vector index, workspaces

Docker / Docker Compose – Containerized deploys

Render – (Planned/Active) one-click cloud hosting

FastAPI – (Planned) thin API that fronts agent calls for apps

React – (Planned) frontends consuming agent endpoints

n8n – Workflow automation to orchestrate intake → embed → respond

PostgreSQL / SQLite – Vector/storage options depending on target env

Object Storage – (Optional) doc archives (S3-compatible)

📦 Current & Planned Use Cases
✅ Current

Stand up an AnythingLLM instance for PAWSitiveOps

Define agent/workspace conventions (naming, roles, retrieval settings)

Set env scaffolding for LLM provider keys and embeddings

🚀 Planned

Compliance Hound – Answers licensing/permit questions and links citations

Sam the Safety Dog – Safety/SOP Q&A with document retrieval

Operations Bulldog – Day-to-day ops, customer-service scripts, checklists

Marketing Poodle – (Optional) social copy & campaign ideas

External Apps – VagalFit, DealAgent007, or IndieSmithy UI consuming the same agent API

n8n Pipelines – Auto-ingest PDFs/URLs → embed → notify → serve in chat

⚙️ Quick Start
1) Environment Variables
Create .env with:

ini
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GROQ_API_KEY=...
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./anythingllm.db
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.example
2) Docker Compose Setup
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: "3.9"
services:
  anythingllm:
    image: mintplexlabs/anythingllm:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/server/storage
    restart: unless-stopped
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker compose up -d
3) Create Workspaces
pawsops-compliance-hound

pawsops-safety-dog

pawsops-operations-bulldog

Attach docs/links → set retrieval settings.

🐍 FastAPI Router Stub
Example main.py for routing chat calls to AnythingLLM:

python
Copy
Edit
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
import requests
import os

app = FastAPI()
ANYTHINGLLM_URL = os.getenv("ANYTHINGLLM_URL", "http://localhost:3001")
API_KEY = os.getenv("ANYTHINGLLM_API_KEY")

@app.post("/api/ask/{workspace}")
def ask_workspace(workspace: str, query: dict):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.post(
        f"{ANYTHINGLLM_URL}/api/v1/workspace/{workspace}/chat",
        headers=headers,
        json={"message": query.get("message", "")}
    )
    if response.status_code != 200:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=response.status_code, detail=response.text)
    return response.json()
📒 Workspace Playbook
A step-by-step guide for creating, maintaining, and updating workspaces is available in docs/PLAYBOOK.md (to be created).
It will cover:

Naming conventions

Role descriptions

Retrieval settings

Document ingestion workflows (manual + n8n automated)

Best practices for prompt engineering in AnythingLLM

🔐 Security Notes
Keep provider keys in .env or Render Secrets

Restrict CORS to trusted domains

Use JWT or API key auth for public endpoints

Log requests for audit and debugging

📚 Lessons Learned
Thin router layer keeps apps clean

Workspace standardization avoids confusion

Automated ingestion is key for freshness

Prompts as config = easier iteration

🗺️ Future Plans
One-click Render deploy (AnythingLLM + FastAPI)

Workspace seeding script

Unified metrics/logging dashboard

React chatbot widget for embedding in sites

Enterprise connectors (SharePoint, S3, GDrive)
