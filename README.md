🐾 PAWSitiveOps – AnythingLLM
PAWSitiveOps-AnythingLLM is the AI backbone for the PAWSitiveOps platform.
It packages an AnythingLLM deployment and integration glue so we can run specialized compliance & operations chatbots for pet/vet centers, then expose them to React/FastAPI apps and n8n automations.

This repo focuses on infrastructure + integration (not the upstream AnythingLLM code).
Think: env setup, deploy configs, routing, and recipes to wire agents into real workflows.

🎯 Purpose
Provide a repeatable deployment of AnythingLLM (cloud or Docker)

Standardize workspace/agent setup for PAWSitiveOps personas (Compliance Hound, Sam the Safety Dog, etc.)

Offer clean endpoints so frontends (React) and services (FastAPI, n8n) can talk to our agents

Keep credentials and provider keys cleanly managed with environment variables

👨‍💻 My Role
Designed the deployment approach (Render/Docker) and env layout

Built integration patterns for webhooks, document ingestion, and chat completions

Planned the multi-agent routing so different PAWSitiveOps bots can serve multiple apps

Documented usage for teammates and future contributors

🛠️ Technologies Used
AnythingLLM – LLM router, vector index, workspaces

Docker / Docker Compose – Containerized deploys

Render – (Planned/Active) one-click cloud hosting

FastAPI – (Planned) thin API that fronts agent calls for apps

React – (Planned) frontends consuming agent endpoints

n8n – Workflow automation to orchestrate intake → embed → respond

PostgreSQL / SQLite – Vector/storage options depending on target env

Object Storage – (Optional) doc archives (S3-compatible)

📦 Current & Planned Use Cases
✅ Current

Stand up an AnythingLLM instance for PAWSitiveOps

Define agent/workspace conventions (naming, roles, retrieval settings)

Set env scaffolding for LLM provider keys and embeddings

🚀 Planned

Compliance Hound – Answers licensing/permit questions and links citations

Sam the Safety Dog – Safety/SOP Q&A with document retrieval

Operations Bulldog – Day-to-day ops, customer-service scripts, checklists

Marketing Poodle – (Optional) social copy & campaign ideas

External Apps – VagalFit, DealAgent007, or IndieSmithy UI consuming the same agent API

n8n Pipelines – Auto-ingest PDFs/URLs → embed → notify → serve in chat

Highlights

Multiple apps hit a single FastAPI router for clean auth/logging

Router forwards to AnythingLLM and selects workspace/agent

Documents are ingested via n8n (scheduled/webhook) and embedded

Responses flow back to the caller with sources/citations where available

⚙️ Quick Start
This repo is an integration layer. It assumes you’re deploying the official AnythingLLM image, then applying our env + routing conventions.

1) Environment Variables
Create .env (or set variables in Render) with keys like:

ini
Copy
Edit
# LLM Providers (choose what you use)
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
GROQ_API_KEY=...

# Embeddings / Storage (example)
EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=openai
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./anythingllm.db

# App
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.example
2) Run (Docker)
nginx
Copy
Edit
docker compose up -d
Visit the exposed port, create your admin, and set up workspaces.

3) Create Workspaces
pawsops-compliance-hound

pawsops-safety-dog

pawsops-operations-bulldog

Attach your docs/links and set retrieval options.

4) Connect Apps
FastAPI: point a route like /api/ask/{workspace} → AnythingLLM chat endpoint

React: call FastAPI; render messages + citations

n8n: a) ingest docs via HTTP node, b) ping embeddings API, c) notify Slack/Teams

🔐 Security Notes
Keep provider keys in .env / Render Secrets (never commit!)

Restrict CORS to your domains

Add a token or JWT layer in FastAPI when exposing public endpoints

Consider request quotas and logging for auditability

📚 Lessons Learned
A thin router layer in front of AnythingLLM keeps frontends simple

Standardized workspace naming prevents messy agent sprawl

Doc ingestion works best when automated (n8n) and versioned

Treat prompts as config, not code, so updates don’t require deploys

🗺️ Future Plans
One-click Render deploy for the full stack (AnythingLLM + FastAPI)

Workspace seeding script (provision agents + upload starter docs)

Unified logging/metrics dashboard (requests, tokens, latency)

Example React chatbot widget for drop-in use across sites

Playbooks for enterprise data sources (SharePoint, S3, GDrive)
